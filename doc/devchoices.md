Design choices
I chose for the most simple language and the most efficient which is a copy of java. The reason for this is so I can work on other stuff. It's efficient to write and to program for me. It's also easy for you to grade because it looks like java.
Dev issues
Most of the issues were fixed with hard debugging the grammar rule and going through the tree with hand, sometimes i would ask my friend to help 
Had an issue with grammar and asked the teacher to help.
Had issues with functions, how to make them work and call them. I asked you on teams about it and resolved it your way.
